<p>The residents of the Village of Justice were asked to show support of law enforcement officers by hanging blue ribbons. Chief Mobile Home Park enthusiastically responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ribbons play tribute to the men and women who have lost their lives and who continue to serve,&#8221; said Fran Mills, Chief&#8217;s property manager.</p>
<p>Begun humbly in the 1950s, Chief was a site for pull-in campers. It has evolved into a thriving company that specializes in the rental and sales of new and pre-owned mobile homes.</p>
<p>Third generation family members own Chief Mobile Home Park. They are involved in day-to-day operations and are dedicated to providing an exceptional, stable and close knit community for Chiefâ€™s residents, all of whom care about their homes as well as each other.</p>
